Davis, Public Relations, Corporate Communications, Media Relations, Crisis Communications, Community Relations</h2><div class='textContainer'><p>"Sue is talented, hard-working, and personable. She was well-liked by both the senior executives with whom she worked and her peers. She was always looking for ways to improve the initiatives upon which she was working to get the maximum results. While I was at Central Hudson, Sue was editor of the employee newsletter. She played an important role in helping promote the employee's recognition programs and served as the internal point of contact for employees seeking more information as the company's position on various issues. She also played an important role within community relations. She developed consumer education programs working with the state energy education committee, and worked with a Teacher Advisory Board to find ways to get this information into schools within the company's service area. Sue did a great job representing the company on nonprofit boards, such as the regional chapters of the United Way and American Cancer Society and with industry groups, such as the National Gas Association and Edison Electric Institute. She was an important part of our team at Central Hudson, and anyone who has worked with her understands what a great asset she can be to an organization."</div><h2>Kari (University of Rochester manager) and Michael Nguyen (Windstream), First Time homebuyers</h2><div class='textContainer'><p>"Sue genuinely cares about the people she works with. From start to finish, Sue was friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, organized, flexible, and responsive. My husband and I met several other agents before we met Sue and not one of them showed the interest and willingness to help that she did. Sue will be honest with you and take all of your wants and needs into consideration when searching for your new home. We will recommend Sue every chance we have!"</div><h2>Cathy Barber, Nurse case manager, Visiting Nurse Services, Sold family home on Honeoye Lake.</h2><div class='textContainer'><p>"Sue is knowledgeable, personable, professional and made our selling experience comfortable and less stressful.
