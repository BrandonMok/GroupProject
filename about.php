            "Superior Service for Real Estate Results" reflects my belief that a service, relationship-driven approach provides the best results for home sellers and buyers. My approach is this, “It is about the people, not the agent”.
        </p>

        <br>


        <p>
            When we are asked “What is your name?”, the next question that often follows is, “Where do you live?” For the most part there is not a lot of flexibility about our name, however the decision where and how to live is multi-faceted, driven by life’s changes and challenges, and what home means to you. Whether you are looking for your dream house, moving for a job relocation, combining households, upsizing or downsizing, I can help you find the right housing fit.

            People know me to be resourceful, persuasive and personable to complete a project or sale in the right way and in the right time. I help people streamline the buying and selling home process. I am known for great customer service, consistent communication, strong attention to detail and ensuring a positive experience.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            My experiences of six years as a Realtor combined with twenty years in corporate communications provides my clients a unique skill set to help them attain their goals. This professional background helps me position seller’s homes for a best sale and for buyers to be focused in their search. I know what it means to communicate to implement effective marketing plans and I know what it means to successfully coordinate a transaction with clients, lenders, attorneys, inspectors, appraisers, and contractors.
            Real estate deals are relationship deals. Because I'm not number one - you are.
