#Group project
Group project for ISTE 240
Created for a realtor in need of personal website 

Hosted on rit servers under one of group member's account
http://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~jpr7169/240/Group/

I created and utilized the majority of the css styling along with content layout within the 'about,' 'community,' and the 'success' pages. I also worked with helping the work of other group members to get completed.
